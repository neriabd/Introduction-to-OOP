Question 1:

a. Whatever Player Strategy
The Whatever player strategy plays a turn by randomly selecting a
valid move from the list of possible moves on the board.

b. Clever Player Strategy
The Clever player at every turn, will pick randomly at the start of every turn
one of the following strategies:
- Random Strategy: The player will randomly select a valid move.
- Traverse Rows Strategy: The player will traverse the rows of the board and
  select the first valid move it encounters.

c. Genius Player Strategy
The Genius player at every turn, will traverse from the last row to the first row
and select the first valid move it encounters.

Question 2:

The benefits of using the a common interface for the player classes are:
a. Abstraction - The common player interface standardizes interactions across all player classes,
ensuring uniformity and eliminating the need to check for specific player types.
This is achieved by using shared methods defined in the interface.

b. Encapsulation - By using a common interface and restricting access to the specific
implementation details of each player class, the internal mechanisms of the implementations
are hidden from outside of the specific player classes.

c. Polymorphism: The shared player interface enables us to inference every player as a "player" without
the need to know which player is that. This enables us the reduce the amount of code and improve
readability by not needing to write behaviors for a specific player type.

Moreover, using a shared player interface is enabling us to open extension to add other player types to
the game easily.
